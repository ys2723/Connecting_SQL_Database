# Connecting SQL Database

This repository consists of codes which help in connecting an SQL data base with the server. 
This repository is for understanding the basics of Backend Development while using SQL Database. 
A sample and fake database of 20 students has been used which lists their marks.

Only [app.js](https://github.com/ys2723/Connecting_SQL_Database/blob/main/app.js) and [db_config.js](https://github.com/ys2723/Connecting_SQL_Database/blob/main/db_config.js) codes have been uploaded. 

The code can perform two functions:
1. It can get the details of the topper by the '/getTopper' method.
2. It can get the details of failed students by the '/getFailedList' method.
